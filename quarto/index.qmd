# Welcome to the Intro to Python Workshops

Our workshops are geared towards R and SAS users who want to explore using Python, a veratile programming language that is especially powerful for tasks like machine learning and working with large datasets. 

In our first three sessions, we will cover installing and setting up python with anaconda, basic python datastructures, and finally a demo logistic regression model with a cancer dataset. Session videos and slides, example code, and other resources will be added to this website periodicially. 

We value your feedback and aim to continually improve these workshops. If you have any suggestions, questions, or ideas, please feel free to share them on our <a href ="https://github.mskcc.org/Python-Workshop/Python-Workshop.github.io/discussions">GitHub Discussions</a> page. We look forward to hearing from you!
