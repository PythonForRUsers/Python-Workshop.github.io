    "\n",
    "**Why OOP Matters for Python Projects**\n",
    "- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) helps organize code into reusable components.\n",
    "- Instead of writing functions in isolation, OOP groups data and behavior into **classes and objects**.\n",
    "- This makes larger projects easier to manage and extend.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key OOP Concepts**\n",
    "- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects.\n",
    "- **Object**: An instance of a class with specific data.\n",
    "- **Methods**: Functions that belong to a class.\n",
    "- **Attributes**: Variables that belong to a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: A Simple Class in Python**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, species):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.species = species\n",
    "\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.name} says hello!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "cat = Animal(\"Whiskers\", \"Cat\")\n",
    "print(cat.speak())  # Output: Whiskers says hello!\n",

    "## **2. Overview of Key Python Machine Learning Libraries**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has several powerful ML libraries. Here are the ones we'll introduce:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **scikit-learn (Machine Learning)**\n",
    "- The most popular ML library in Python.\n",
    "- Includes tools for classification, regression, clustering, and more.\n",
    "- Example usage:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\n",
    "model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- [Read more about scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **PyTorch (Deep Learning Framework)**\n",
    "- Open-source machine learning library primarily used for deep learning.\n",
    "- Supports dynamic computation graphs and GPU acceleration.\n",
    "- Example usage:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import torch\n",
    "x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- [PyTorch Documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **TensorFlow (End-to-End ML Framework)**\n",
    "- Designed for large-scale machine learning and deep learning applications.\n",
    "- Provides high-level APIs for building and training neural networks.\n",
    "- Example usage:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "x = tf.constant([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- [TensorFlow Documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **XGBoost (Gradient Boosting for Structured Data)**\n",
    "- Optimized gradient boosting library designed for performance and efficiency.\n",
    "- Commonly used in Kaggle competitions and structured data analysis.\n",
    "- Example usage:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import xgboost as xgb\n",
    "model = xgb.XGBClassifier()\n",

    "## **3. Introduction to k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) Algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is k-NN?**\n",
    "- A **supervised learning algorithm** used for classification and regression.\n",
    "- It classifies a data point by looking at the `k` closest neighbors in feature space.\n",
    "- Works well for smaller datasets but can be slow on large ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How k-NN Works:**\n",
    "1. Choose a value for `k` (number of neighbors to consider).\n",
    "2. Calculate the distance between the new data point and all existing points.\n",
    "3. Assign the most common class label among the `k` nearest points.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example of k-NN in Python (Using `scikit-learn`)**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\n",
    "model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)\n",
    "model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "predictions = model.predict(X_test)\n",
    "```\n",
