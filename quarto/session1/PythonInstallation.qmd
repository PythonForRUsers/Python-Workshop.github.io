# 1. Introduction to Python

## What is Python?

![](images/paste-1.png){width="220"}

> Python is a **high-level**, **interpreted**, and **general-purpose programming language** first developed by Guido van Rossum in 1991.

Python has gained much popularity in the past 20 years.
Its user group has expanded into a large and active scientific computing and developer community that spans numerous academic and industrial fields.
Nowadays, Python has a powerful ecosystem of [external packages (libraries)](https://pypi.org/) for data science, artificial intelligence, and software development.

Python is cross-platform and open-source.
In Python, you can easily install packages with the built-in installer `pip` or package manager `conda`, just as you do with `install.packages()` in R.

## What can Python do?

Just like R, Python is an open source and versatile programming language that allows users to perform a wide range of data analysis and computational tasks.
While R is particularly useful in statistical analysis and visualizations, Python has been used in many distinct areas, such as:

-   Machine Learning and Deep learning

-   Web Development

-   Scripting & Automation

-   Cloud Computing

-   Game Development

-   Cybersecurity

## Why learn Python‚Äìas Biostatisticians?

Within the field of biostatistics/ bioinformatics, Python has become a core tool for biomedical data analysis due to its versatility, reproducibility, and strong ecosystem of scientific libraries.
Below are some areas where Python can be useful and some essential libraries.

-   **Statistical analysis**

    While R is the go-to tool for statistical analysis, Python has caught up with many equivalent libraries and functions:

    -   `statsmodels`/ `scipy.stats` provide **regression modeling** and **hypothesis testing**.
    -   `lifelines`/ `scikit-survival` support **survival analysis** and plotting.

-   **ML/DL ecosystem**

    Python dominates in machine learning and AI development:

    -   `scikit-learn` is a rich **machine learning** library that supports both supervised regression an dclassification (e.g., random forests, gradient boosting) and unsupervised clustering (e.g., K-means).
    -   `TensorFlow`, `PyTorch` are **deep learning** libraries widely used for computer vision and natural language processing.
    -   `optuna`, `Ray` can be integrated into ML/DL workflows for easy and efficient **model training, hyperparameter tuning, fine-tuning**, etc.

-   **Omics data analysis**

    Emerging packages that provide standard omics data preprocessing and analysis pipelines allow Python to become increasingly popular in the field of bioinformatics:

    -   `scanpy`, `anndata` are libraries for single-cell RNA-seq data loading, preprocessing, and analysis.
    -   `Biopython` is a set of tools for biological computation that performs file parsering (BLAST, FASTA, GenBank, etc.), sequence analysis, clustering algorithms, etc.
    -   `pysam` works with BAM/SAM/VCF files.

## Python vs. R: Differences

While both programming languages are popular for data analysis and computation, Python and R differ in their underlying code structure, the scope of functionality, and the extensibility of tasks they can perform.
Here is a non-exhaustive summary of some key differences:

::: {tbl-colwidths="[15, 30, 30]"}
| **Feature/Task** | **R** | **Python** |
|-------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Programming logic** | Mostly function-oriented | Function and object-oriented ‚Äì structured around **classes** |
| **General-purpose programming** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Less ideal ‚Äì designed mainly for working with data | ‚úÖ Strong ‚Äì ML & AI, software development, scripting, etc. |
| **Computational power** | ‚úÖ Vectorization allows operating on all elements of a vector at once <br> ‚úÖ Best for statistical analysis <br> ‚ö†Ô∏è Memory-intensive; often slow for reading large data and performing large computations | ‚úÖ Generally faster for loops <br> ‚úÖ Strong support for GPU computing <br> ‚úÖ Memory-efficient for handling large objects and complex computations |
| **Package availability** | ‚úÖ Excellent for statistical analysis (glm, survival, ggplot2) <br> ‚ö†Ô∏è Good options for ML (caret, mlr3) but few DL packages <br> ‚úÖ Great for omics-focused analysis (Bioconductor, ComplexHeatmap, Seurat) | ‚òëÔ∏è Improving on statistical packages (statsmodels, lifelines) <br> ‚úÖ Best for ML/DL (scikit-learn, pytorch, keras) <br> ‚úÖ Established packages specialized in processing large omics datasets (scanpy, scvi-tools) |
| **IDE & Reproducible environments (notebooks etc.)** | ‚úÖ RStudio <br> ‚úÖ RMarkdown, Quarto | ‚úÖ Visual Studio Code, JupyterLab, PyCharm, Spyder, etc. <br> ‚úÖ Jupyter Notebooks, Quarto |
:::

## Essential Tools for Python Programming

To get the most out of Python‚Äìespecially for data science and reproducible research‚Äìit's important to set up an integrated, flexible programming environment.

Here is a list of tools we recommend using:

-   **Conda**: a powerful package and environment manager for Python.
-   **Visual Studio Code**: a lightweight code editor that integrates programming + plots + terminal + etc.
-   **Jupyer Notebook**: an interactive computing tool that combines code execution, text documentation, and visualizations.
-   **Git (GitHub)**: for version control, collaboration, and publishing code.

#### **Conda (via Miniconda)**

Conda is a package manager, much like CRAN + Bioconductor, and can be utilized across languages (Python, R, C/C++ etc.).
It also simplifies Python environment management, similar to `renv` in R but more powerful and flexible, ensuring dependency isolation without cluttering the global system.

Conda can be installed via either Miniconda (lightweight version) or the Anaconda Distribution (full version).
We will use the former for the purpose of this workshop series.

#### **Visual Studio Code**

Akin to RStudio, Visual Studio Code (often called VS Code) is an IDE for multi-language coding (Python, R, Java, etc.).
It has many features integrated within it, including interactive coding via Jupyter Notebook or Quarto, version control with Git, and built-in terminal and debugging tools.

Next, we will walk through installing and setting up these tools.

# 2. Python Installation and Setup

There are many ways to do install Python locally.
For the purpose of the workshop, we recommend one way of installation via [**Miniconda**](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/main) that works universally across Windows and MacOS platforms.

Miniconda comes with Python, the conda package manager, and a minimal number of libraries.
It is a minimal version of the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/anaconda/main), an open-source distribution of Python designed for scientific computing, data science, machine learning, and AI development.
Miniconda is relatively lightweight compared to Anaconda, which adds on top of the Miniconda distribution the Anaconda Navigator graphical user interface (GUI) and over 300 pre-downloaded libraries.

![Difference between conda, miniconda, and Anaconda](images/anaconda-explained.png){fig-align="left" width="420"}

While Anaconda can be an alternative for people who do not want to use command line tools for managing packages, in this workshop, we will use Miniconda for better efficiency in the installation process.

| Feature | Anaconda | Miniconda |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------|
| Size | ‚ö†Ô∏è\~3-4 GB (slow to download) | ‚úÖ\~400 MB (lightweight) |
| What is included? | conda, Python (latest version), 300+ popular packages, Anaconda Navigator | conda, Python (latest version), essential packages only |
| User-friendly? | ‚úÖGUI available (Anaconda Navigator) | ‚ö†Ô∏ècommand-line only ‚Äî `conda` |

: Anaconda vs. Miniconda

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏èFollow-Along: Install Miniconda (Python + conda) {#follow-along-install-miniconda-python-conda}

Let's walk through steps to install **Minconda**.

1.  For the latest Miniconda installers for Python 3.12, navigate to the [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success#miniconda).

2.  Download the **64-bit graphical installer** according to your system (Windows or MacOS):

    *Note: Make sure you are downloading from the **Miniconda Installers** section, not Anaconda!*

    -   Alternatively, check out the [Quick command line installation guide](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install#quickstart-install-instructions) to install Miniconda through command line interface.

3.  Run the installer (`.exe` for Windows / `.pkg` for MacOS)

    -   select `Just Me` for installation type ‚Äì recommended; doesn't require admin rights.

        ![](images/anaconda-install-1.png){width="500"}

        ::: callout-tip
        ## Installing for current user only

        You don't need to install for all users most of the time.
        This option requires admin privileges which you might not have on your MSK laptop.
        :::

    -   Keep the default for installation location.
        E.g.,

        -   Windows: `C:\Users\<user_name>\AppData\Local\miniconda3`
        -   MacOS: `/Users/yourname/miniconda3`

    -   Customize the advanced installation options:

        -   ‚ùå *Add Miniconda to my PATH environment variable* ‚Äì **NOT** recommended
        -   ‚úÖ *Register Miniconda3 as my default Python 3.12*

        ![](images/miniconda-install.png)

    ::: callout-warning
    ## Do not add Miniconda to PATH‚ö†Ô∏è

    It is recommended that you do not add Miniconda to system's PATH environment variable, as it might lead to conflicts with your other Python installations or accidentally break software using the system Python.

    Instead, you could later run `conda init` in **Anaconda Prompt** to configure the terminal shells (like PowerShell or Command Prompt) to recognize the `conda` command.
    :::

4.  Complete installation.
    This might take a few minutes to complete.

5.  Check installation‚Äìverify that Python and Conda are successfully installed.

    -   Windows:

        -   Open the Start Menu and run **Anaconda Prompt**.

        -   Type the following command.

            ``` bash
            conda --version
            python --version
            ```

        -   You should see the current versions of your Python and Conda being returned‚Äìsuch as `conda 24.9.2` and `Python 3.12.4` (the exact numbers might differ).
            This means that Miniconda is properly installed and initialized.

    -   MacOS:

        -   Open **Terminal**.
            Configure your shell to make the `conda` command available.

            ``` bash
            source ~/miniconda3/bin/activate
            conda init zsh # or conda init bash if you are using bash
            ```

        -   Then **restart your Terminal** and type:

            ``` bash
            conda --version
            python --version
            ```

        -   You should see the current versions of your Python and Conda being returned, which means everything has been correctly installed.

# 3. Virtual Environment & Package Management with Conda

## What is Conda?

Conda is a cross-platform command line tool for managing packages and environment via the `conda` **command line interface (CLI)**.
It can handle both Python and non-Python dependencies (R, C, system binaries, etc.), making it particularly powerful.

You can install conda via installers such as Miniconda or the Anaconda Distribution.

## Conda for Managing Packages

Conda installs packages from [**channels**](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/psm/cloud/channels)(repositories), such as the default Anaconda channel or community-maintained channels like `conda-forge`.

To install packages from the default Anaconda repository:

``` bash
# Install a single package
conda install scipy

# Install a specific version of a package
conda install scipy=0.15.0 

# Install multiple packages
conda install scipy=0.15.0 pandas matplotlib
```

If the package is located in another channel, such as `conda-forge`, you can manually specify the channel when installing the package.
For example:

``` bash
conda install conda-forge::pytorch 
# or 
conda install pytorch --channel conda-forge
```

To update a package:

``` bash
conda update scipy
```

*Note that this automatically updates the package to the highest version supported by the current Python series. For example, Python 3.9 updates to the highest available in the 3.x series.*

To remove a package (or multiple packages at once):

``` bash
conda remove scipy pandas matplotlib
```

#### **Conda vs. Pip**

If a Python package is not available through any conda channel, consider using the pip package manager:

``` bash
pip install
```

::: callout-note
## Difference Between `conda install` and `pip install`

Long story short: ***Pip installs Python libraries only,** while **conda can install both Python and non-Python packages** (e.g., R, C/C++, system binaries)**.***

It is generally recommended that you only use `conda install` within a conda environment, as anything installed via pip won't be recognized by conda and vice versa.
Using the two interchangeably might overwrite or break packages and mess up the environment.

**What if the Python package is unavailable through conda?**

The best practice is to ***install everything with conda first, then use pip only when the package is not available in conda.***

Check out this [blog](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/using-pip-in-a-conda-environment) for more information on using pip in a conda environment.
:::

## What is a Virtual Environment?

A **virtual environment** is an isolated, self-contained workspace that includes its own **language interpreter** and **package dependencies**.
Each environment operates independently, ensuring that projects are isolated from one another and from the system‚Äôs global setup.

In the previous section, we installed Python 3.12 via Miniconda and set it as the default (global) Python.
However, you might need a different version of Python‚Äìsay, Python 3.8--or a different set of packages for a particular project.
In this case, creating a virtual environment allows you to maintain a completely separate Python setup, including its own Python version and `/site-packages` folder.

You can create as many environments as needed ‚Äî ideal for managing multiple projects with different requirements.

## Why Use Virtual Environments?

You may find the flexibility of environments beneficial in many cases.

-   **Avoid Conflicts.** Creating virtual environments can help resolve potential conflicts between different projects that might require different Python version or conflicting dependencies. Changes made to one environment won't affect other projects that use different environments.
-   **Easy Management**. When your work is temporary or that you simply want to experiment things without having to worry about breaking things, you can work within a virtual environment and later delete it when needed.
-   **Sharing Environment**. You can share your Python environment and whole list of dependencies with other people through a copy of the `.yml` file.
-   **Reproducibility.** They work as time capsules, allowing you to come back to an older project at any time later by recreating the virtual environment.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏èFollow-Along: Create a Conda Virtual Environment

Using `conda`, we can **create, activate, update, export,** and **remove** virtual environments, each with its own Python version and set of packages.
Let's practice creating a virtual environment and installing packages into it using the command line.

::: {.callout-important icon="false"}
## üìåPrerequisite

Be sure you have installed Miniconda by following the previous [tutorial](#follow-along-install-miniconda-python-conda) to access the `conda` command line interface.
:::

::: callout-tip
The [Anaconda Navigator](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/tools/anaconda-navigator/main) is an alternative to creating conda environments without the terminal skills.
However, for users comfortable using the command line tool, we recommend the `conda` approach for better speed, control, and stability,
:::

1.  Open **Anaconda Prompt** (Windows) or **Terminal** (MacOS)

2.  Create the virtual environment.
    Replace `<env-name>` with the name you want to give your environment.

    ``` bash
    conda create --name <env-name>
    ```

    *Note: you can use `-n` (shorthand) and `--name` interchangeably.*

3.  To create an environment with a specific Python version:

    ``` bash
    conda create -n <env-name> python=3.10
    ```

4.  To create an environment with a specific package(s):

    ``` bash
    conda create -n <env-name> python=3.10 scipy pandas matplotlib
    ```

    or install packages later with separate commands:

    ``` bash
    conda create -n <env-name> python=3.10
    conda install -n <env-name> scipy pandas matplotlib
    ```

5.  You can also install packages from channels other than the `defaults` (your can pass multiple channels for the package search):

    ``` bash
    conda install -n <env-name> scipy --channel conda-forge --channel bioconda
    ```

    or explicitly specify the channel from which you want the package to be installed:

    ``` bash
     conda install -n <env-name> conda-forge::scipy
    ```

6.  Now, activate your environment.

    ``` bash
    conda activate <env-name>
    ```

7.  You can verify that your installation was successful by looking up the list of all current environments on your computer.

    ``` bash
    conda env list
    ```

    The default location for the installed conda environments (except for the base conda environment) is `..\miniconda3\envs\<env-name>`

8.  Deactivate the conda environment.

    ``` bash
    conda deactivate
    ```

    ::: callout-warning
    ## Avoid activating on top of another virtual environment!

    Always `conda deactivate` first before activating another one because environments can be **stacked**.
    This can lead to chaos in the packages in both environments.

    üí°**Tip**: make sure you see `(base)` at the beginning of the terminal prompt when you are about to activate an environment.
    :::

9.  Removing an environment.

    -   Remove by environment name:

        ``` bash
        conda env remove -n <env-name>
        ```

    -   Remove by environment folder path:

        ``` bash
        conda env remove --prefix </path/to/your/env>
        ```

### üëâCreate an Environment from an `environment.yml` File {#create-env-yml-file}

1.  You can also create a virtual environment from a `.yml` configuration file.

    ``` bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```

    Example: An environment file contains information about the environment name, channels, and dependencies:

    ``` bash
    name: python310
    channels:
      - defaults
    dependencies:
      - python=3.10
      - pandas
      - numpy
    ```

    ::: callout-note
    Download the `.yml` file for this Python workshop series [here](https://github.mskcc.org/Python-Workshop/Python-Workshop.github.io/tree/main/Downloadable/environment.yml).
    This file includes the Python version and required channels and dependencies for completing the workshop sessions.
    :::

2.  Then activate the new environment:

    ``` bash
    conda activate python310
    ```

    This way, we can skip the cumbersome steps to set up an environment from scratch and easily recreate an environment shared by others or share our environment settings with others.

| Task | Command |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Create an environment | `conda create --name <env-name>` |
| List all environments | `conda env list` |
| Remove an environment | `conda remove --name <env-name> --all` |
| List packages in current environment | `conda list` |
| Export environment to `.yml` | `conda env export > environment.yml` |
| Recreate environment from `.yml` file | `conda env create -f environment.yml` |

: Summary: A list of useful conda commands for managing environments.

# 4. Integrated Development Environment

An **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** is a software application that brings together everything you need to write and run code and manage projects.

It typically includes:

-   A code editor
-   Terminal panel
-   A compiler or interpreter to execute code
-   Debugger and version control integration

For Python, there are many existing IDEs that offer great compatibility and multi-functionality.

| Tool | Description |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **VS Code** | Lightweight, powerful IDE (extensible with Python & Jupyter extensions) |
| **JupyterLab** | Interactive notebooks for analysis & reports |
| **Spyder** | RStudio-like interface, good for scientific Python |
| **PyCharm** | Full-featured Python IDE (more for software dev) |

We will use the VS Code IDE for the workshop series.

## Visual Studio Code

![](images/vs-code-icon.png){width="100"}

> **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** is one of the most popular open-source code editors with many features.

-   **Multi-Language Programming.** VS Code supports multiple programming languages including Python, R, C/C++, JavaScript, etc.
-   **Integrated Git Source Control.** VS Code automatically recognizes and uses the computer's Git installation. You can easily track changes, stage, and commit changes to your working branch.
-   **Variety of Project Development Support**. You can add extra features such as language packs, debugging tools, Git/Github features, and remote server connector by installing extensions from the Extension Marketplace.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏èFollow-Along**:** Set up Jupyter Notebook in VS Code

We‚Äôll now walk through setting up your Python coding environment in VS Code with full support for virtual environments and Jupyter notebooks.

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## üí°Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following:

-   **Miniconda**: see [‚ñ∂Ô∏èFollow-Along: Install Miniconda (Python + conda)](#follow-along-install-miniconda-python-conda)
-   **VS Code**: [Download and install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
:::

### Step 1: Install Required VS Code Extensions

1.  Launch VS Code.

2.  Open the **Extensions** panel from the left toolbar (or `Ctrl+Shift+X` on Windows/ `Cmd+Shift+X` on Mac).

    ![](images/qs-python-ext-install.gif)

3.  Install the following extensions:

    -   **Python**: To support Python language, debugging, documentations, etc.
    -   **Jupyter**: To support rendering Python documents from Jupyter Notebooks or Quarto files.

    ::: callout-important
    You still need to install Python (Miniconda) to your computer for these extensions to fully function.
    :::

### Step 2: Create a Conda Virtual Environment

You can create an environment in one step using the shared [environment.yml](https://github.mskcc.org/Python-Workshop/Python-Workshop.github.io/tree/main/Downloadable/environment.yml) file.

``` bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

If you want to create your own environment or use existing ones, install these necessary packages to allow your Python to work with Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code:

-   jupyter
-   ipykernel
-   pyyaml

``` bash
conda install jupyter ipykernel pyyaml -c conda-forge
```

### Step 3: Configure the Environment in VS Code.

1.  Open the **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows / `Cmd+Shift+X` on Mac).

2.  Search for and select "**Python: Select Interpreter**".

3.  Choose your conda environment (e.g., `python-intro-env`).

    -   If it doesn't pop up, click **Enter interpreter path...**

    -   Manually enter the path to your conda virtual environment Python executable:

        -   Windows: `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\miniconda3\envs\<env-name>\python.exe`

        -   macOS: `Users/<username>/miniconda/envs/<env-name>/python`

    ::: {#find-python-path .callout-note icon="false"}
    ## üîéFind your conda Python executable path

    To search for the conda Python interpreter location on your computer, open the **Anaconda Prompt** or **terminal**:

    ``` bash
    conda activate <env-name>
    ```

    Then, locate your Python executable by typing the following:

    -   Windows: `where python`
    -   macOS: `which python`
    :::

### Step 4: Open a Python Project and Create a Jupyter Notebook File

1.  If you have an existing Python project you wish to work on in VS Code, you may open the project folder in VS Code.

    -   Open from the VS Code Welcome page:

        ![](images/vs code-welcome-page.png){width="774"}

    -   Or by selecting **File \> Open Folder** (`Ctrl+K Ctrl+O`)

2.  To create a new Jupyter Notebook file, go to **`File > New File`** and select Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`).

3.  Select the correct **kernel** (conda environment):

    -   In the top-right corner of the notebook, you will see a **Select Kernel** button

    -   Choose the kernel that matches your conda environment (e.g., `python-intro-env (Python 3.10.0)`)

4.  If you don't see the environment showing up:

    -   Make sure your conda env has the dependencies installed:

        ``` bash
        conda install ipykernel jupyter pyyaml
        ```

        Then restart VS Code or reload the window (`Ctrl+Shift+P` \> `Reload Window`).

    -   If all packages are installed but the issue persists, manually specify the Python path (see [üîéFind your conda Python executable path])

You are all set!
