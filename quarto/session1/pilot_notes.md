# Notes from session 1!

Session went well! We can streamline it though. 

## Some notes - 

1. we should probably skip talking about R and stuff and get right to the tutorial. I think the more we talk before we actually install things the more questions there will be. 
2. Might be worth downloading everything first and then talking through the intro. It can take a while for things to download!
3. 

We need to keep everyone on track and not get distracted ourselves. (Use sticky note method: everyone puts sticky note when they are done with step, move on when ~90% of people have doen step.)

## On the question of "Will this break my R?"
No it won't. R studio pretty much isolates itself. You can check what environment R studio is running on with the R Studio Terminal (and just use conda deactivate to get out of an environment if it is activated).
