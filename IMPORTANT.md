# Important information for session development!

If you're making a session:
1. Put all needed files in a folder titled "session#" where # is the session number. 
2. In the yml header, make sure you have 'output-file: "session#.html"' under the 'html:'. Again # is the session number. 
3. When you merge your branch to main, make sure the only thing you are merging is the session folder!
