There are many ways to install Python and many choices of code editor (too many in our opinion!). For the scope of this workshop, we will show one way that we think is intuitive, efficient, and offers flexible and reproducible workflow, particularly from the perspective of R users and statisticians.\n",

VS Code, akin to RStudio, offers a powerful yet customizable IDE with Python-specific extensions, an interactive Jupyter notebook interface, and seamless Git integration. Together, Miniconda and VS Code provide an efficient, modular setup, making Python adoption intuitive while maintaining the reproducibility and project structure familiar to R users.\n",
